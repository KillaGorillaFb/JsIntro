   Purpose: Write a program that shows 
   all numbers between 1 and 100 with the 
   following exceptions:
   It shows "Fizz"
   instead if the number is divisible by 3.
   It shows "Buzz" instead if the number is 
   divisible by 5 and not by 3.
   When it 's done, improve it so that the 
   program shows "FizzBuzz" instead for numbers 
   divisible both by 3 and by 5.
